        (also <i>canopy disengagement,</i>

        <i>caonopy shyness,</i>
        <sup>[2]</sup>
        <i>or inter-crown spacing</i>
        <sup>[3]</sup>
        </i>) is a phenomenon observed in some tree species . in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4]</sup>
        <SUP>[5]</SUP>
        the phenomenon is most prevalant among trees of the same species. but also occurs in beween trees of diffrent species.<sup>[6]</sup>
        <sup>[7]</sup> there exist many hypotheses as yo why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggest that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larve.<sup>[8]</sub>

        The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not certain.<sup>[6]</sup>
        the phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across diffrent species, an example of convergent evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup> 
    </p>
    <p>
        some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches lead to ''reciprocal pruning'' of adjacent trees. trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds. As the result of abrasions and collisions, there is an induced crown shyness reponse. studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns are artifically prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown shyness between same branches of the same organism. Proponetsof this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in condition conductive to this pruning, including windy forest, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forest where branches are flexiable and limited in lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup> By this explanation, variable flexibility in lateral branches has a large bearing on degree of crown shyness. 
        </p>

        similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth nodules disrupt bud tissue such that it is unable to continue with lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. jacobs who studied the crowns shyness patterns in eucaltptus in 1955, belived that the trees' growing tips were sensetive to abarasion, resulting in canopy gaps.<sup>[13]</sup> Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the branches of <i>picea sitchensis</i> (sitka spruce) and <i>larix kaempferi</i> (japanese larch) suffered physical damage due to abrasion, which killed the leading shoots.<sup>[14][15]</sup>
    </p>

        A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with mutal light sensing by adjacent plants. the photoreceptor-mediated shade avoidance response is a well-documented behavior in a variety of plant species.<sup>[16]</sup> Neighbor detection is thought to be functional of several unique photoreceptor. plants can sense the proximty of neighbors by sensing backscatterd far-red light, task widely thought to be accomplished by the activity of phytochrome photoreceptors.<sup>[17]</sup> Many species of plant respond to an increase in far-red light (and, by extension, encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the far-red stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongatio.<sup>[18]</sup> Similarly, plants use blue lights to induce the shade-avoidence response, likely playing a role in the recognition of neighboring plants,<sup>[19]</sup> thought this was just starting to be recognised in 1988.<sup>[20]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        The charaterization of these behaviors might suggest that crown shyness is simply the result of mutual shading based on well-understood shade avoidence responses.<sup>[6][21]</sup> Malaysian scholar Francis S.P. Ng, who studied <i>Dryobalanops aromatica</i>, suggested that the growing tips were sensitive to light levels and stopped growing when nearing the adjacent foilage due to the induced shade.<sup>[6][21]</sup>

        A 2015 study has suggested that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> shows diffrent leaf placement strategies when grown amongst kin and unrelated conspecifics, shading dissimilar neighbors and avoiding kin. This response was shown to be contingent on the proper functioning of multiple photosensory modalities.<sup>[22]</sup> A 1998 study proposed similar system of photoreceptors-mediated inhibition of growth as explanations of crown shyness,<sup>[6][21]</sup> thought a casul link between photoreceptors and crown asymmetry had yet to be expermentally proven. This might explain instances of intercrown spacing that are only exhibited between conspecifics.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
